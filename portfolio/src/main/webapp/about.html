                    <p style="font-size:1vw;text-align:justify">My name is Timoithy Mazenge a rising junior at Fisk University at Fisk University Nashville, Tennesse. I grew up in Zimbabwe which is in the southern of Africa. Growing up in third-world country
                        meant that I did not attend the best school or had advanced technology at my disposal. However, witnessing the ecomomic hardships of my conmtry in the 2008 hyper-inflation, I became determined to 
                        change the narrative of my family, community and country. With the few resources I had, I workked extremely hard in high school. After high school, I applied for scholarships I acquired a full scholarship 
                        at Fisk University. Through Fisk University, I found my passion for  Computer Science. Computer Science has landed me two Internship opportunities at Google where I have had the opportunity of working With
                        amazing Software Engineers working on products that impact the world. Such a opportunity has helped me to stay focused and determined to pursue my goals. With my education, I hope to start my own company in my country Zimbabwe, 
                        as a way to alleviate the high unemployment rates and shrivelled economy. <br> I graduate in the class of 2022 and I hope to start
                        my career at technology company like Google, Facebook or Microsoft.<p>

                    <p style="font-size:1vw;text-align:justify;">Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers, bordered by South Africa, 
                        Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 14 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, 
                        Shona, and Ndebele the most common. The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal 
                        enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations, from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government, 
                        and from which it withdrew in December 2003. The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations, the Southern African Development Community , the African Union, and the Common Market for Eastern and 
                        Southern Africa. Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980, when his ZANU–PF party won the elections following the end of white minority rule; he was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987 until his resignation in 2017. Under Mugabe's authoritarian regime, the state security apparatus dominated the country and was responsible for widespread
                        human rights violations The country has been in economic decline since the 1990s, experiencing several crashes and hyperinflation along the way. On 15 November 2017, in the wake of over a year of protests against his government as well as Zimbabwe's rapidly 
                        declining economy, Mugabe was placed under house arrest by the country's national army in a coup d'état. On 19 November 2017, ZANU–PF sacked Robert Mugabe as party leader and appointed former Vice-President Emmerson 
                        Mnangagwa in his place.<p>
